### ❤️ Self Introduction 
##### Hello. My name is SongYi Choi. One day I met a friend who is a developer. After I talked with her, I became very intrigued in programming. Since that day, I have started studying programming. And I recognized I like to make something by using programming language. I find the process of making,designing and solving problem(debugging) very interesting. Especially successful debugging gives me the most pleasure. I think as a web developer, I should keep studying programming and improve my programming skills. I am a person who have efficient communicating skill and enjoy learning new things. I want to be a nice developer who can make clean code, and also a coworker that can create positive environment for those around me. Thank you :)
