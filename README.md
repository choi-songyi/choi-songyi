### ❤️ Self Introduction 
##### Hello. My name is SongYi Choi. One day I met a friend who is a developer. After I talked with her, I became very intrigued in programming. Since that day, I have started studying programming. And I recognized I like to make something by using programming language. I find the process of making,designing and solving problem(debugging) very interesting. Especially successful debugging gives me the most pleasure. I think as a web developer, I should keep studying programming and improve my programming skills. I am a person who have efficient communicating skill and enjoy learning new things. I want to be a nice developer who can make clean code, and also a coworker that can create positive environment for those around me. Thank you :)  

##### 您好！ 我是崔頌伊. 我半年前開始學編程. 一開始學的時候, 我感覺可能不會學得很好, 但是我越來越懂怎麼解決問題. 現在呢, 我對編程的興趣只增不減. 我覺得前端工程師的美, 就是可以看到自己寫程式的結果. 我找到錯誤的時候很開心很有成就感. 雖然我的專業不是編程, 但是因為所以我更努力了. 現在比起以前剛開始學的時候更有經驗, 學的速度也更快一點了. 還有我是一個可以跟同事維持良好關係的人. 我喜歡大家一起工作, 一起努力, 一起加油的氣氛！我希望自己可以當一個可以幫到同事的好員工.
