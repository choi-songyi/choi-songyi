### ❤️ Self Introduction 
##### Hallo. My name is songyi choi. One day I met one friend who is developer. When I was talking with her, I was very interested in programming. After that day, I have started studying programming. And I recognize I like make something by using programming language. I think it is very interesting that writing code for making,designing and solving problem(debugging). Especially debugging let me feel the most pleasure. I think web developer should keep studying about programming. I am the person who have efficient communicating skill and enjoy learning something new. I want to be a nice developer and coworker who can make clean code! Thank you :)
